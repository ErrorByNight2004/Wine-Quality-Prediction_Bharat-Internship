# Wine-Quality-Prediction_Bharat-Internship
This project is about the prediction of red wine quality using different machine learning algorithms.

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulfates
Alcohol
Objectives


The objectives of this project are as follows:

To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine
